 abstract="""Animal behavior has to constantly adapt to changes, for instance when unexpectedly switching the state of an environmental context. For an agent interacting with this kind of volatile environment, it is important to respond to such switches accurately and with the shortest delay. However, this operation has in general to be performed in presence of noisy sensory inputs and solely based on the accumulated information. It has already been shown that human observers can accurately anticipate the motion direction of a visual target with their eye movements when this random sequence of rightward/leftward motions is defined by a bias in direction probability. Here, we generalized the capacity of these observers to anticipate different random biases within random-length contextual blocks. Experimental results were compared to those of a probabilistic agent which is optimal with respect to this switching model. We found a better fit between the behaviorally observed anticipatory response with that of the probabilistic agent compared to other models such as a leaky integrator model. Moreover, we could similarly fit the level of confidence reported by human observers with that provided by the model and derive a common marker for subject inter-variability, titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation. Such results provide evidence that in such a volatile environment human observers may still efficiently represent an internal belief, along with its precision, and use this representation for sensorimotor control as well as for explicit judgments. This work proposes a novel approach to more generically test human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.""",

* (AUTHOR) Hello, I am Laurent Perrinet from the Institute of Neurosciences of
la Timone in Marseille, a joint unit from the CNRS and the AMU

* (OBJECTIVE)


* Let's me first describe the motivation of this work...




Today I will present some recent results on detecting switches in a sequence and potential role for RL and causality measures


In particular, I will try to give some principles of active inference, framed in a practical example of a dynamic, poissbly volatile environment and how we may use it to anticipate ---- and my main goal in general is to illustrate how this theory may give a creative and efficient tool to do psychophysics.

In summary, the design of our experimental setting is therefore very similar to the previous experiment but with a more general construct:

- using the same 3-layered generative model, we generated sequences of directions

- and generated 3 blocks of 200 trials

- with an average block length of 40 trials

We anticipated that such an  experiment for which we simply recordedd the eye movements should be more difficult for observers compared to the classical experiments with longer (400 trials), fixed blocks and...

This is why we added a supplementary experiment for each observer but on a different day for which we asked at every trial to give a subjective, conscious evaluation of the direction of the next trial + a confidence about this inference. Once this information given by the subject, we were showing the actual outcome.

Interestingly, we used exactly the same sequence, allowing to make a direc comparison of the results of both experiments

We called this experiment the bet experiment.

First, we overlay the results of the bet result for one of the 12 subjects

We rescaled th value given by the observer so that it fits to 0 (sure it goes left) to 1 (sure it goes right)

We observe a pretty good fit of this trace as a function of trial number


In particular, we see 2 main effects:
- results are more variable when the bias is around .5 than when it is high (close to zero or one)
- switches were detected quite rapidly but with a certain delay of a few trials. Indeed, note that this plot shows the entire sequence but that observers had only access to some internal representation of the memory of the previous observations. When faced with some new observations, the observer has to constantly adapt his response to either exploit this information by considering that this observation belongs to the same sub-block or to explore a novel hypothesis. This compromise is one of the crucial component that we wish to explore.

Let's now have a look at EMs...

we notice a quite nice linear correlation (black line) for both experiments; of the order of that found in the classical experiment with fixed blocks and a vartiety of bias values. This is surprising as the blocks are of random length, observer can still adapt to such a volatile environment.

Another visualization, the scatter plot of acceleration  as a function of probability bet shows also that there is a correlation between both  variables.

This allows to make a first point: it is possible to use more genreal models such as hierarchical generative models.

However, while this results seem encouraging, a more finer analysis may be necessary.

Indeed, these raw psycholophysical results are encouraging but since we used a generative model for generating the sequence, let's see if we can build a Bayesian model which would be optimal wrt to this generative model.

Let's remember our hierarchical generative model.

At any given trial, we wish to construct an algorithm which

We will introduce a fundamental component of Bayesian models : a latent variable

this new variable will be used to test different hypothesis which will be evaluated to predict future states. it is called latent because it aims at representing a variable that is latent (or hidden) to the observer

in our case, we will assume that the bayesian model knows about the structure of the generative model and we will set it to the current run-length $r$, that is, at any given trial, the hypothesis that the past r observations belong to the same block. of course a wrong choice of a latent variables (let's say the temperture in the experimental room) may give unexpected results, even is the bayesian model is "optimal" - an essential point to understand in bayesian inference

Let's now see the application of our model to a simple synthetic example before applying it to the experimental protocol that we used in our two experiments


- we show two panels, one below which displays the value of the belief for the different run-length, and one above where we will show the resaulting prediction of the next outcome.
we obtain for any given sequence different values at the given trial in the form of columns for any possible run-length: the belief,
and the sufficient statistics for the beta distirbution which allow to provide with an estimate of the current probability

- first, we show the value of probability, low probabilities are blueish while high probabilities. at every trial, the agent evluates the value for the different possible run lengths, generating a column. by showing all columns we generate this image which shows the evaluation along the sequence of trials.

- second we show above the sequence of observations that were shown to the agent in a light black line. the read line gives an evaluation of the most probable a posteriori probability as the probability to hte run-length the maximum a posteriori belief on the differettn beliefs about run-lengths. using the estimate of the precision at this

We remark two main observations:

- first, beliefs grow at the beginning along a linear ridge, as we begin our model by assuming there was a switch at time 0. Then we observe that at a switch (hidden to the model), the model
such that belief is more stronlgly diffused until the probability

-second, we may use this information to read-out the information the most probable probability and the confidence interval as shown by the red dashed lines (.05, and .95)


This is in contrast with a fixed length model, for which
- the delay will always be similar
- there is no dynamic upDATE OF THE INFERRD probability


as a summary, for any given sequnce, we get an estimate of the probability given by the ideal observer. we will now see how we can apply that to our experiemntal protocol.

           Let's use our model on the different sequences that were generated in our experiments in the different blocks.

we the same arrangement of panels, we show below the dynamical evolution of beliefs and above the resulting readout from the model

we see that as in the synthetic example above, there is a correct detection of switch after a short delay of a few trials

in particular, from this correct detection, the value of the inferred probability approaches the true one as the number of observations increase in one subblock.

again, we see that a fixed length model gives a similar output but with the two disadvantages described above

Let's now see how this applies to our experimental results by comparing human observers to our bayesian agent.

Among our 12 subjects, we show four representative examples. we will use the same figure as in the section with raw results

but we superposed to our 2 variables, the value of the readout inferred probability along with the confidence interval.

compared to the raw results which were using the true (hidden) probability, it seems qualitatively that it follows well the traces observed experimenetally
- first, both have similar delays in ddetercting a switch, reflecting the diuffusion of probability
- second, precisions seems to increase in bigger sub-blocks as a function of the inferred run-length

as a result, the inferred probability as a function of time constitutes a useful regressor

we therefore used a kernel density estimation which clearly show the relationship between the agent probability and that reported by human observers
- on the right, we

to summarize, we have shown that
- there is a correlation in the anticiapatory response of eye movements in a volatile environment that is captured if we know the true probability
- that a fixed length models captures some of this correlation, but that
- our online bayesian changep[oint model better captures this correlation and that this may hint at the neural mechanisms used to anticipate in a dynamic environment

#
# Preparing Effective Presentations
# ---------------------------------
#
# Clear Purpose - An effective image should have a main point and not be just a collection of available data. If the central theme of the image isn't identified readily, improve the paper by revising or deleting the image.
#
# Readily Understood - The main point should catch the attention of the audience immediately. When trying to figure out the image, audience members aren't fully paying attention to the speaker - try to minimize this.
#
# Simple Format - With a simple, uncluttered format, the image is easy to design and directs audience attention to the main point.
#
# Free of Nonessential Information - If information doesn't directly support the main point of the image, reserve this content for questions.
#
# Digestible - Excess information can confuse the audience. With an average of seven images in a 10-minute paper, roughly one minute is available per image. Restrict information to what is extemporaneously explainable to the uninitiated in the allowed length of time - reading prepared text quickly is a poor substitute for editing.
#
# Unified - An image is most effective when information is organized around a single central theme and tells a unified story.
#
# Graphic Format - In graphs, qualitative relationships are emphasized at the expense of precise numerical values, while in tables, the reverse is true. If a qualitative statement, such as "Flow rate increased markedly immediately after stimulation," is the main point of the image, the purpose is better served with a graphic format. A good place for detailed, tabular data is in an image or two held in reserve in case of questions.
#
# Designed for the Current Oral Paper - Avoid complex data tables irrelevant to the current paper. The audience cares about evidence and conclusions directly related to the subject of the paper - not how much work was done.
#
# Experimental - There is no time in a 10-minute paper to teach standard technology. Unless the paper directly examines this technology, only mention what is necessary to develop the theme.
#
# Visual Contrast - Contrasts in brightness and tone between illustrations and backgrounds improves legibility. The best color combinations include white letters on medium blue, or black on yellow. Never use black letters on a dark background. Many people are red/green color blind - avoid using red and green next to each other.
#
# Integrated with Verbal Text - Images should support the verbal text and not merely display numbers. Conversely, verbal text should lay a proper foundation for each image. As each image is shown, give the audience a brief opportunity to become oriented before proceeding. If you will refer to the same image several times during your presentation, duplicate images.
#
# Clear Train of Thought - Ideas developed in the paper and supported by the images should flow smoothly in a logical sequence, without wandering to irrelevant asides or bogging down in detail. Everything presented verbally or visually should have a clear role supporting the paper's central thesis.
#
# Rights to Use Material - Before using any text, image, or other material, make sure that you have the rights to use it. Complex laws and social rules govern how much of someone's work you can reproduce in a presentation. Ignorance is no defense. Check that you are not infringing on copyright or other laws or on the customs of academic discourse when using material.
